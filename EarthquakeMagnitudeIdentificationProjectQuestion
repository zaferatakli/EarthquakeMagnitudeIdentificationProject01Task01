**Earthquake Magnitude Classification Project**

**Objective**
This project aims to develop a simple program that determines an appropriate descriptor based on the earthquake magnitude entered by the user.

---

**Tasks**
- The program will take earthquake magnitude input from the user.
- The entered magnitude value will be checked against ranges on the Richter scale.
- A descriptor corresponding to the determined range will be displayed on the screen.
- For example, if the user enters 5.5, the program will indicate that an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.5 is considered a moderate earthquake.

**Algorithm / Pseudocode**
Pseudocode is widely used to express the basic algorithm of a program in a more understandable and abstract way, making it easier to think and design independently of a programming language:

1. Take earthquake magnitude input (magnitude) from the user.
2. If the magnitude is less than 2.0:
   - Print "Micro"
3. If the magnitude is between 2.0 and 3.0:
   - Print "Very minor"
4. If the magnitude is between 3.0 and 4.0:
   - Print "Minor"
5. If the magnitude is between 4.0 and 5.0:
   - Print "Light"
6. If the magnitude is between 5.0 and 6.0:
   - Print "Moderate"
7. If the magnitude is between 6.0 and 7.0:
   - Print "Strong"
8. If the magnitude is between 7.0 and 8.0:
   - Print "Major"
9. If the magnitude is between 8.0 and 10.0:
   - Print "Great"
10. If the magnitude is greater than 10.0:
    - Print "Meteoric"
11. End the program.

**Key Considerations**
- The program should accurately check the value entered by the user and determine the appropriate descriptor.
- Utilize the flow in the pseudocode or algorithm to implement the core logic of the program.
- The project should be developed as a simple console application.
